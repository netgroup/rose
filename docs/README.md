Segment Routing is a form of source routing. The Segment Routing (SR) architecture gives the possibility to include a list of instructions (called _segments_) in the packet headers. A segment can represent a _topological_ instruction (e.g. a node to be crossed) or a service instruction (e.g. an operation to be executed on the packet). 

The Segment Routing architecture can be implemented using MPLS or IPv6 as forwarding plane. We only focus on the IPv6 implementation, called _SRv6_, in which the _segments_ are identified by means of IPv6 addresses. SRv6 supports advanced services and network functions like Traffic Engineering, Service Function Chaining and Virtual Private Networks in IPv6 backbones and datacenters.
